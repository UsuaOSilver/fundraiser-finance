## Project description

A trustless platform for communities to create charities and donate for their respective cause. Being powered by Ethereum, everything is transparent and trustless. Organizers can set goals in both $ETH and $USDC. By allowing $USDC, we provide the organizers an option to choose non-volatile denominating currency. During the period of collection, all the collected funds will be earning yield from Aave and are held in an escrow. If the goal is met under the collection period, the funds are moved to the organizer's wallet. However, if the goal is not met under the time, then everyone who donated gets an option to withdraw their funds. Upon success of a charity goal, 2% of the fees will be collected by the platform in order to maintain the project. In addition to this, participants will be given an NFT as a badge for their donations.
